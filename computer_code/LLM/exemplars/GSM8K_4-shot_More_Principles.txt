Let's solve mathematical word problems in a careful, formal manner. The solution will follow the Peano format: 
1- Each sentence in the solution either introduces a new variable or states a new equation. 
2- The last sentence gives the goal: which variable will contain the answer to the problem. 
3- Each equation only uses previously introduced variables. 
4- Each quantity is only named by one variable.
5- Use all the numbers in the question.

You must also adhere to these rules, since SymPy's solver is used to solve the problems:
1- If an answer is an operation of more than one variable, use parenthesis to group the variables - e.g. [[answer a + b]] is invalid with the SymPy solver, but [[answer (a + b)]] is valid.
2- Never use odd symbols such as currencies (e.g. $, €, etc.) or units of measure (e.g. cm, L, kg, etc.) in the equations - e.g. [[eq c = $10.00 / 2]] is invalid with the SymPy solver, but [[eq c = 10 / 2]] is valid.
3- Never use inequalities (e.g. >, <, >=, <=) in the equations - e.g. [[eq a > 5]], [[eq b >= a * 5]] are invalid with the SymPy solver. Find a way to express the same information using equalities.
4- Use letters from the English alphabet only (a, b, c, ..., z) for the variables.

Q: Mary had 5 apples. The next morning, she ate 2 apples. Then, in the afternoon, she bought as many apples as she had after eating those apples in the morning. How many apples did she end up with?
A: 
Let a be the number of apples Mary started with [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 5]]. 
Let b be how many apples she had in the morning after eating 2 apples [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = a - 2]]. 
Let c be the apples she bought in the afternoon [[var c]]. 
Since she bought as many as she had after eating, we have [[eq c = b]]. 
Let d be how many apples she ended up with [[var d]]. We have [[eq d = b + c]]. 
The answer is the value of d [[answer d]].

Q: Liam has 3 times as many dollars as his brother. His brother has $10. How many US dollars does Liam have?
A: 
Let a be the number of dollars Liam has [[var a]].
Let b be the number of dollars his brother has [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = 10]].
We have [[eq a = 3 * b]].
The answer is the value of a [[answer a]].

Q: Mario and Luigi together had 10 years of experience in soccer. Luigi had 3 more than Mario. How many did Mario have?
A: 
Let a be the number of years Mario had [[var a]]. 
Let b be the number of years Luigi had [[var b]]. We have [[eq a + b = 10]]. We also have [[eq b = a + 3]]. 
The answer is the value of a [[answer a]].

Q: The planet Goob completes one revolution after every 2 weeks. How many hours will it take for it to complete half a revolution?
A: 
Let a be the number of hours in a week [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 168]]. 
Let b be the number of hours in a revolution [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = a * 2]]. 
Let c be the number of hours in half a revolution [[var c]]. We have [[eq c = b / 2]]. 
The answer is the value of c [[answer c]].
